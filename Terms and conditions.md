###  1.1 About Butterscotch AI
Butterscotch AI is a generative AI platform that may include text-based AI chat, image or video generation, real-time video calls, or other AI-driven features. We leverage third-party open-source AI models to deliver the outputs ("Outputs") based on your prompts and inputs ("Input").

###  1.2 Relationship to Other Policies
Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use personal data. Although it does not form part of these Terms, it is an important document that you should read. Additional service-specific terms, usage policies, or brand guidelines may also apply, and by using the Services, you agree to comply with them.

## 2. AGE REQUIREMENT AND ELIGIBILITY
###  2.1 Minimum Age
You must be at least 18 years old to use the Services. If you are under 18, you cannot register or use the Services under any circumstances. By creating an account or otherwise using the Services, you represent that you are 18 or older.

As between you and Butterscotch AI, you own your Input, and you own your Output to the extent permitted by law.
Butterscotch AI assigns any of its rights in your Output to you, subject to your compliance with these Terms.
Similarity of Outputs: Because AI-generated content is often probabilistic, similar or identical Outputs may be generated for other users. You have no exclusive rights to any particular Output.
### 3.3 Prohibited Content & Activities

Privacy Violations: Disclose or compromise another person's private data without their consent, or engage in doxing, stalking, etc.
Malware or Disruption: Upload viruses or other malicious code, or circumvent any technical measures designed to enforce usage limits or security.
Hate Speech: Generate or distribute content that demeans or incites violence against a protected group based on race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or other characteristics.

## 11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
### 11.1 Informal Resolution
If you have a dispute or concern, please contact us at support@butterscotchai.app. We prefer to resolve issues informally first. We each agree to attempt to resolve disputes in good faith before initiating formal legal action.

### 11.2 Arbitration Agreement
Except for claims that may be brought in small claims court, you and Butterscotch AI agree to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy ("Dispute") arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration.

### 11.3 Class Action Waiver
All disputes must be pursued individually, and not as part of any class or consolidated action. Neither party can act as a class representative or participate as a class member in any class, representative, or consolidated proceeding.

### 11.4 Arbitration Rules
Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator under the rules of an established arbitration body (e.g., AAA or NAM). The arbitrator can award damages on an individual basis that a court could. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision.

### 11.5 Opt-Out
You may opt out of arbitration within 30 days of creating an account or the date these Terms first become effective for you, by sending a written notice to support@butterscotchai.app. If you opt out, you may pursue disputes in court.

### 11.6 Severability
If a court finds any part of this arbitration provision invalid (other than the class action waiver), the remainder shall still apply. If the class action waiver is found unenforceable, the entire arbitration section is void.

These Terms (including any referenced policies) constitute the entire agreement between you and Butterscotch AI concerning the Services, superseding any prior agreements or understandings.

### 13.4 Severability

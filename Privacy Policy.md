# Butterscotch AI Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how Butterscotch AI (“Butterscotch AI,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise processes personal information relating to your access and use of our Android and iOS mobile applications, including lifelike AI Characters, chat-based AI features, real-time video calls, and any related digital or offline services that link to this Policy (collectively, the “Services”).

By accessing or using the Services, you agree to the practices described in this Policy. If you do not agree, you must not access or use the Services. Undefined capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Butterscotch AI Terms of Service.

## 1. Introduction & Scope
Overview. Butterscotch AI's Services include lifelike AI Characters, chat-based AI, and one-on-one real-time video call functionality. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and process personal information through these features.
Additional Notices. We may provide supplemental privacy notices for certain products or services (e.g., if biometric data is collected or for region-specific requirements). These notices should be read together with this Policy.
Age Restrictions. The Services are not intended for individuals under 18. If you are not of the required legal age, please do not use our Services.
## 2. Information We Collect
We collect personal information directly from you, automatically when you use our Services, and from third parties, as outlined below.

### 2.1 Information You Provide Directly
Account & Profile Information:
Name, username, email address, password, or other identifiers you choose to share.
User-Generated Content:
Text prompts, images, audio/voice clips, or videos uploaded or created in the course of interacting with AI Characters or chat features.
AI Character profiles you build and share with other users.
Video calls: When you engage in real-time one-on-one video calls, we collect audio and video data from your device's camera and microphone (with your permission).
Note: If we offer or enable any call recording features, we will notify you and request the necessary permissions (where required by law).
Payment Information:
We may collect minimal transaction data (e.g., purchase confirmations, transaction IDs) when you make in-app purchases via Google Play Store, Apple App Store, or Razorpay.
Financial details (such as your credit card number) are typically collected directly by the app store providers or Razorpay, not by us.
Communications & Support:
When you contact us (e.g., via email or in-app support), we collect information about your request or inquiry.
Sensitive Information: Please do not share sensitive personal information (e.g., health, religious beliefs, government ID numbers) unless strictly necessary. If you choose to include such data, you consent to its processing per this Policy.

### 2.2 Information We Collect Automatically
We and our third-party service providers (e.g., analytics providers like Google Analytics for Firebase) may automatically collect certain information about your device and how you interact with our Android and iOS apps, including:

Device Information: Device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers (e.g., IDFA, Android Advertising ID), mobile network info.
Usage Data: Pages/screens viewed, in-app features used, navigation paths, timestamps, crash reports, error logs.
IP Address: For approximate location (city, state, or region).
Cookies / SDKs: While cookies are typical in browser environments, our mobile apps may use equivalent technologies (like software development kits and device identifiers) to store or read data on your device for analytics, personalization, and security.
### 2.3 Information from Third Parties
Social Media or Third-Party Login: If you choose to link your Butterscotch AI account with a third-party service (e.g., Google, Apple), we receive basic profile info from that service, subject to the permissions you grant.
App Stores & Payment Gateways: We receive limited data (purchase amount, transaction status, etc.) from Google Play Store, Apple App Store, or Razorpay.
Referrals/Publicly Available Sources: We may collect information if you were referred by another user or if it's publicly available.
## 3. How We Use Your Information
We may use your personal information for the following purposes or as otherwise disclosed at the time of collection:

Facilitate real-time video calls, AI chats, and lifelike Character interactions.
Operate, maintain, and optimize the user experience (e.g., customizing AI responses).

Create and manage your account, authenticate logins, and keep the Services secure.
Service Improvement & Analytics
Analyze usage patterns, enhance our AI/machine learning models (often using aggregated or de-identified data).
Monitor and fix technical issues.
Payments & Purchases
Track and manage in-app purchases.
Communicate with you about transactions (e.g., confirmations, receipts).
Communication
Respond to support requests or feedback.
Send important updates about new features or policy changes.
Fraud Prevention & Legal Compliance
Prevent, investigate, or manage fraudulent or unlawful activity.

In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we may transfer your information, subject to confidentiality obligations.
Consent & Other Purposes
Where required, obtain your consent to use the data for specific reasons.
Any additional purpose disclosed at the time of collection or otherwise compatible with the original purpose.
We may anonymize or aggregate personal information so it no longer identifies you. We may use de-identified or aggregated data for research, analytics, and training our AI models.

## 4. Real-Time Video Calls
One-on-one video calls are a key feature of Butterscotch AI. When you initiate or receive a video call:

Access to Camera & Microphone: We will request permission to access your device's camera and microphone. You can grant or deny these permissions in your device's settings.
Call Content: The audio and video streams are processed in real time to enable the call; we do not systematically record or store your video calls unless you explicitly consent to a recording feature (if offered).
Metadata: We may log metadata (e.g., call duration, connection quality) to improve our service.
Please be mindful of any personal information you share verbally or visually during a video call. If you do not wish to share certain information, do not display it or speak it on camera.

## 5. Cookies, SDKs & Similar Technologies
Mobile Environments often rely on SDKs or unique device identifiers instead of cookies. We and our partners may use these technologies to:

Remember your preferences or login details.
Analyze app performance and user interactions.
Provide certain functionalities (e.g., push notifications, auto-login).
You can manage or restrict these technologies through your device settings (e.g., disable ad personalization) or in-app privacy controls. Note that disabling certain features may limit functionality.

## 6. When We Disclose Your Information
We may disclose your personal information under these circumstances:

Affiliates & Subsidiaries
Within our corporate family for consistent service operations, product improvements, or research.
Service Providers/Vendors
Third parties assisting us with cloud hosting, data analysis, payment processing, AI technology, or customer support.
Payment Processors: Google Play Store, Apple App Store, or Razorpay handle most payment details. We receive minimal data to confirm transactions.
User-Generated Content
Content you designate as “public” (e.g., publicly shared AI Characters) or chat in a group context may be visible to other users.
Video calls are private by default unless you voluntarily invite a participant or consent to recording (if offered).
Legal Obligations & Safety
If required by law or necessary to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of others (e.g., responding to subpoenas, court orders).
Business Transactions
In a merger, acquisition, financing, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. Your data may be transferred subject to confidentiality obligations.
Consent or At Your Direction
If you explicitly agree to share your data with a third party or direct us to do so.
